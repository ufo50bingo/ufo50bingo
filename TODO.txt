Board state lives forever, but feed does not.
Need to capture feed at first sync
Feed data should include

INCLUDE SQUARE MARKING AND REVEAL!!
- time of event
- player name
- color change
- square index

color detection is wrong if a player makes a mistake I guess?

remove all events from spectators
keep reveal events only from players in the final score
